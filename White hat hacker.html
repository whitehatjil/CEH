            <H2> What is white hat hacker?</H2>
            <p class="all-browsers"> A white hat hacker -- or ethical hacker -- is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks.<br> However, unlike black hat hackers -- or malicious hackers -- white hat hackers respect the rule of law as it applies to hacking. Many white hat hackers are former black hat hackers. <br>The terms come from old Western movies, where heroes often wore white hats and the bad guys wore black hats.

                White hat hackers only seek vulnerabilities or exploits when they are legally permitted to do so.<br> White hat hackers may do their research on open source software, as well as on software or systems they own or have been authorized to investigate, including products and services that operate bug bounty programs.<br> These types of programs reward individuals with money for disclosing security flaws.
                
                Unlike black or gray hat hackers, white hat hackers fully disclose all the vulnerabilities they find to the company or product owner who is responsible for fixing the flaws so the issues can be resolved before they are exploited by malicious hackers.</p>
                
                <h2> White hat hacking tools and techniques</h2>

                <p> White hat hackers, especially those performing external penetration tests (pen tests), use the same hacking techniques and tools as black hat hackers. But white hat hackers do so with the intent of helping an organization improve its security posture. Common examples include the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Pen testing :: </b>Ethical hackers use their skills to help identify potential entry points and system vulnerabilities and then try to penetrate the organization's network or exposed system.</li>

                    <li> <b>Email phishing ::</b> White hat hackers conduct legitimate anti-phishing campaigns to find and fix possible issues within an organization's network before an attack can occur. Email phishing tricks the recipient of the email into providing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious file or link.</li>

                        <li><b>Denial-of-service (DoS) attack ::</b> This type of attack temporarily disrupts or degrades the performance of a machine or network resource, making it unavailable to users. A white hat hacker can simulate this type of attack to help an organization develop its DoS response plan.</li>

                        <li> <b>Social engineering ::</b> White hat hackers use behavioral techniques to test the security level of a company's systems so it can prevent an attack. Social engineering attacks take advantage of human nature and trust in order to trick employees into breaking security protocols or giving away sensitive information.</li>

                       <li> <b> Security scanning ::</b> Ethical hackers use a variety of tools to automate the process of finding known vulnerabilities. These range from tools to detect web application vulnerabilities, such as Acunetix or Netsparker, to open source pen testing tools, including Metasploit Framework or Nikto.
